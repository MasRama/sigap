> Trust-first school management — verify attendance with camera and geolocation.

SIGAP helps schools manage academic years, classes, students, teachers, schedules, journals, grades, and parent access. The anti-fraud confirmation flow requires teachers to capture a selfie and share their location before class, so every journal entry is tied to a real person at a real place.

## The craft of building with machines.

Say to your machine: *"Add a products CRUD."*

That's all. The machine reads `AGENTS.md` for conventions, loads the `crud-pattern` skill for the workflow, checks `migrations/` for table shapes, writes the types, the migration, the queries, the validator, the handlers, the routes, the page — then runs `npm run check` to verify its own work. You review. You ship.

```
types/models.ts          →  interface Product { ... }
migrations/...ts         →  CREATE TABLE products (...)
queries/products.ts      →  findProductById(), createProduct(), ...
validators/schemas.ts    →  CreateProductSchema (Zod)
handlers/products.ts     →  productsPage, listProducts, addProduct, editProduct, removeProducts
routes/web.ts            →  Route.get/post/put/delete('/products', ...)
Pages/products.svelte    →  Full UI with table, forms, toast notifications
```

Ten files. Correct conventions. The machine did it all — you just asked.

---

## Five quiet principles.

Each one removes a reason for the machine to guess.

**01. Flat, by design.**
Files at arm's reach. No deep nesting to navigate. The machine finds things by name, and so do you.

**02. Functions, not classes.**
Standalone functions the machine writes accurately. No inheritance to hallucinate, no hidden state to chase.

**03. Raw SQL, not magic.**
Every query explicit, readable, predictable. The machine writes SQL fluently. No query builder syntax to invent.

**04. No hidden behavior.**
Traceable end to end. No decorators, no implicit middleware, no magic resolvers.

**05. Few dependencies.**
Fewer APIs to learn. Fewer mistakes to make. Each one earns its place.

See [`docs/decisions/`](./docs/decisions/) for ten ADRs explaining *why* each decision was made.

## What makes SIGAP AI-first.

| Layer | What | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Context** | `AGENTS.md` (root + 11 nested) + 9 skills + 10 ADRs | The machine reads conventions, not guesses. Skills loaded on demand to save context window. |
| **Topology** | `CODEMAP.md` (auto-generated index) | The machine knows what exists before searching. Reads one file instead of the whole tree. |
| **Scaffolding** | `npm run gen:resource` | Eleven files scaffolded with correct conventions (including test stub). The machine can't make structural mistakes. |
| **Enforcement** | `npm run lint:layers` (17 rules) + 200+ tests + pre-commit hook | The machine pushes a violation → blocked. Naming, layer boundaries, import direction, anti-patterns. |
| **Verification** | `npm run check` | One command. The machine doesn't need to remember three. |
| **CI** | 9 steps: typecheck → layer lint → AGENTS accuracy → security → links → file size → type safety → eval harness → tests | Last line of defense. Cloud agents can't bypass with `--no-verify`. |
| **Policy** | Dependency policy (16 categories: allowed vs banned) | The machine checks the table before suggesting a dependency. No Prisma, no JWT, no React. |
| **Pitfalls** | 10 real mistakes AI makes, with fix | The machine reads before coding. Prevents common errors. |

## Begin.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasRama/sigap.git my-app && cd my-app
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555). You're live.

> Migrations run automatically on startup. To reset: `npm run migrate:fresh`

## How to talk to the machine.

SIGAP is built to be driven by natural language. The machine reads `AGENTS.md` for conventions, loads skills on demand, and verifies its own work with `npm run check`. A good prompt is short and names the resource + fields.

**Add a full-stack resource:**

```
Add a products CRUD with name (string), price (number), and description (text).
```

The machine runs `npm run gen:resource products -- --fields="name:string,price:number,description:text"`, then `npm run migrate`, then `npm run check`. You review the diff.

**Add a field to an existing resource:**

```
Add an is_active boolean column to users. Default true. Update the form and table.
```

**Fix a bug:**

```
The /users page shows raw JSON instead of HTML. Fix it.
```

The machine reads `lint:layers` rule L3, finds the handler returning `jsonSuccess` from a `*Page` handler, switches to `res.inertia()`.

**Security audit:**

```
Run an OWASP Top 10 audit on the auth flow. Report findings in the standard format.
```

The machine loads the `pentest-pattern` skill and runs the POCs against the running server.

**Rules of thumb:**
- Name the resource and fields — don't say "add a thing"
- One resource per prompt — the machine stays focused
- Let the machine run `npm run check` itself — don't paste the output back
- Review the diff, don't just trust it

---

## The verification loop.

The machine writes code, then verifies its own work. You don't trust the diff — the gates do.

```
Agent writes code
  │
  ▼
npm run check
  ├── tsc --noEmit           (typecheck)
  ├── lint:layers            (17 architectural rules)
  ├── check:freshness        (CODEMAP not stale)
  ├── check:agents           (AGENTS.md Structure tables accurate)
  ├── check:security         (7 dangerous pattern checks)
  ├── check:links            (markdown links resolve)
  ├── check:filesize         (no file over 500 lines)
  ├── check:types            (no new `any` beyond baseline)
  └── vitest                 (266 tests)
  │
  ├── All green → commit
  └── Any red → agent reads the error, fixes, re-runs check
```

The error messages are written for the agent, not just the human. Each violation includes the fix and a link to the relevant skill. This is the maker-verifier pattern: the agent that wrote the code is not the one grading it — the gates are independent and deterministic.

**Prove it works:**

```bash
npm run eval
```

Runs a full end-to-end test of the AI-first tooling: generates a resource with `gen:resource`, verifies all 11 files follow conventions (naming, barrel exports, route entries, raw SQL, no ORM, test stub with pre-wired mocks), runs the gates on the generated code, then cleans up — leaving zero trace. 39 checks, all must pass.

This runs in CI on every push — if `gen:resource` or any gate breaks, CI fails before merge.

## Architecture.

```
Browser (Svelte 5 + Inertia.js)
  │  router.visit() for pages · axios for data
  ▼
Server (ultimate-express / uWebSockets.js)
  │
  ├── Handlers (functions)
  │     ├── Queries (raw SQL via better-sqlite3)
  │     └── Services (Auth, Logger, Storage, CacheStore, LoginThrottle)
  │
  └── SQLite (embedded, zero-config)
```

**Two route types:**

| Type | Called by | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Page | Browser navigation | `res.inertia('pageName', { data })` |
| Data | `axios` from Svelte | `jsonSuccess()`, `jsonError()`, `jsonCreated()` |

---

## What's inside.

| Area | Stack |
|------|-------|
| Server | ultimate-express (uWebSockets.js, 250k+ req/s) |
| Frontend | Svelte 5, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS 4, Zag JS |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3, raw SQL migrations |
| Auth | Session-based + RBAC (roles & permissions) |
| Security | CSRF (double-submit cookie), rate limiting, XSS sanitization, security headers, timing-safe comparisons, login throttling |
| Storage | Local file storage with sharp image processing, magic byte validation |
| DX | Path aliases, structured logging (Pino), Vitest, Docker-ready |

---

## Tooling.

```bash
# Scaffolding (optional — the machine can also write files manually)
npm run gen:resource products -- --fields="name:string,price:number"

# Verification
npm run check              # lint + typecheck + layer lint + tests
npm run lint:layers        # 17 layer boundary + naming + import direction rules

# Topology
npm run codemap            # regenerate CODEMAP.md (auto-indexed)
```

---

## Database.

Migrations are raw SQL strings executed by a lightweight migrator. No ORM, no query builder — just SQL.

```bash
npm run migrate            # run pending migrations (auto-runs on startup)
npm run migrate:rollback   # rollback last batch
npm run migrate:status     # show pending/applied
npm run migrate:fresh      # drop all + re-migrate + seed
npm run seed               # run seeders
```

---

## Deployment.

```bash
# Docker
docker build -t nara-app .
docker run -p 5555:5555 nara-app

# Manual
npm run build && npm start
```

Set `NODE_ENV=production` and configure SSL for production use. See [.env.production.example](./.env.production.example) for reference.
